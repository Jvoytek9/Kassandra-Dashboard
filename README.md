# Kassandra-Dashboard

If interested in running a local version, clone this repo and make sure to have pip installed.

Then, make a separate virtualenv like so (this example makes a virtual environment named venv at the given path):
python -m venv c:\path\to\myenv

copy the contents of the cloned repo into this new venv folder. Activate the venv like so:
cd venv\path\to\myenv\Scripts
then type "activate" and hit enter

The name of your venv should appear next to the command prompt. Now type:
cd ..

And finally:
pip install requirements.txt

Then, running the app/app.py file in your editor of choice will boot up a local Flask server, which you can then do as you please with.
